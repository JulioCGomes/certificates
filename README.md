🎓 My Certificates

Welcome! Here I keep track of all the courses, workshops and training I've taken throughout my career as a developer.
From the backend track to content on architecture, best practices, cloud and more! ☁️💻

It's like a digital bulletin board — whenever something new happens, it appears here. 🚀

Feel free to take a look! 👀✨
